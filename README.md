# Capstone_project-SIT-Dash
Capstone project for the bootcamp - a full stack application that visualizes different kinds of data about applications and courses of the academy in a visual, graph base dashboard. After completion of the bootcamp the project was further developed and implemented into the academy's backend systems by me.
